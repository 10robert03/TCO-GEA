# TCO Calculator for GEA (Hackathon MVP)
This project was developed during a Hackathon to provide a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for calculating the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for GEA’s industrial equipment.

### Note: This is "Hackathon Code" – developed under time pressure to demonstrate a concept. It is not production-ready and focuses on functionality over architectural purity.

## The Challenge
Industrial customers often struggle to see the long-term financial benefits of high-quality equipment compared to cheaper alternatives. Our task was to create a tool that visualizes:

Initial investment costs (CAPEX).

Operational expenses (OPEX) like energy consumption, maintenance, and downtime.

The "Break-even" point where a GEA machine becomes more profitable than a competitor's.

## Tech Stack
Language: Python 

Logic: Financial modeling based on energy efficiency and maintenance intervals.

## Key Features (MVP)
Parameter Input: Easy input for energy costs, labor costs, and service cycles.

Comparative Analysis: Side-by-side comparison of different machine configurations.

## Status & Disclaimer
Status: Functional MVP.

Known Issues: Limited error handling, hardcoded sample data for GEA machines and other data.
